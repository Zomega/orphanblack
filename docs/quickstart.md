# Installation

Install `orphanblack` as you would any other python package. Since it is listed on PyPI,

```
$ pip install orphanblack
```

should be perfectly servicable, though an installation from source will also work.

# Basic Usage

```
$ cd path/to/my/python/program
$ orphanblack scan
$ orphanblack report
```

To scan other langauges, or to adjust any of the myriad settings `orphanblack` uses, read the User Guide, particularly the section on the Command Line Interface.
